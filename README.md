A complete and clean page structure using semantic HTML tags
Consistent styling with Flexbox, responsive images, and media queries
A professional look with clear navigation, typography, and spacing
Fully responsive behavior across screen sizes
Validated HTML and CSS
Submission Guidelines

Deploy your final webpage using any hosting platform (recommended: Netlify, GitHub Pages, or Vercel).
Submit the live URL of your deployed webpage in the response section.
